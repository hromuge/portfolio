          In these 4 years, I completed my apprenticeship for software development where I acquired alot of my skills and experience which I still use today. <br>
          In my time at Glue Software Engineering AG, I was mainly working on two different projects. One of which was for the Swiss Federal Office of Justice (Bundesamt f√ºr Justiz, BJ),
          the other one was for the Swiss Confederation. <br>
          The project for the BJ goes under the name of "UPReg" (Register der Urkundspersonen), which is a register for notaries in Switzerland.
          The project for the Swiss Confederation is called "eSignr", which is a tool for the secure electronic signing of documents.

          At this time, I was a big fan of a video game called "Minecraft", which is completely written in Java. <br>
          When playing this game, you have an endless possibility of modifying the game with so-called "mods".
          I also tried my hand at making a few mods, as well as setting up my own server so I could play with my friends.
          This has helped me made my first steps into the world of coding.

          In this year, we started to have computer science classes at school. I was already familiar with the concepts of coding,
          so I already had somewhat of a headstart when we started to solve simple problems in a simple visual language called "Scratch".

          My journey began at the age of 10 when I first signed up for a video game creation course during summer vacation. In this course, we used a game engine called "Construct 2". <br>
          This is a HTML-5 based engine that executes JavaScript code in the background. To make it easier for beginners, it's a visual-oriented engine that allows you to create games without writing actual code.
